**Furniture: Our Profitable Engine**

**Insight**
Furniture category is a strong performer, marked by high inventory turnover (31.7) and low average COGS (56.3K), driving robust profit margins. Lowest average units sold (523 items) confirms swift stock movement and efficient capital use. This success is underpinned by Supplier C's lowest COGS for furniture (50.07K) and lowest lead time variability: 7.67 days. It's a highly profitable, well-managed segment.

**Clothing: Our Major Challenge**

**Problem:**
High daily sales are offset by low inventory turnover and significant overstocking. This stems from fashion's dynamic nature, driven by rapid trends and seasonal weather, exacerbated by inaccurate forecasting and long supplier lead times leading to oversized orders.

**Insight:**
The Clothing category faces significant issues. Low inventory turnover (28.9), high average units sold (543 items), and relatively high COGS (60.4K) point to costly overstocking and profitability erosion. This is worsened by Supplier C's highest COGS for clothing, at 63.43K. Root causes likely include poor demand forecasting, procurement misalignment, and product lifecycle/marketing issues.
