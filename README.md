# Supply-Chain-Analysis

## 1. Background and Overview
This document provides a high-level overview of a comprehensive supply chain performance analysis across **four key suppliers (A, B, C, D)** and several **product categories (Furniture, Clothing, Electronics, Accessories)**. The analysis focuses on critical Supply Chain metrics such as **back order rates, transportation costs, perfect order rates, lead time variability, and inventory management indicators like COGS and inventory turnover.** The timeline of this analysis spans from 2020 to 2024. The aim is to identify areas of strength, pinpoint operational challenges, and provide actionable recommendations to optimize supply chain efficiency and enhance profitability.

## 2. Key Supply Chain Metrics Analyzed 
The analysis is built upon detailed quantitative data points for each supplier and category, including:

**Supplier Performance Metrics:**

- Back Order Rate (percentage of unfulfilled orders)

- Transportation Cost per Unit ($)

- Perfect Order Rate (indicating fulfillment accuracy and completeness)

- Lead Time Variability (days, reflecting consistency in delivery)

**Category Performance Metrics:**
 
- Safety Stock Coverage (days)

- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by supplier and category ($k)

- Inventory Turnover (rate)

- Average Units Sold (items)

## 3. Executive Summary
This executive summary highlights the key findings and strategic recommendations from the comprehensive supply chain performance analysis. Significant disparities in supplier performance and category health have been identified, leading to tailored recommendations aimed at optimizing efficiency and profitability.

## 4. Insights Deep Dive
Initial insights reveal significant disparities in supplier performance and category health:

### Supplier Performance: 

**Supplier A** showcases remarkable inventory control with the lowest back order rate, yet faces critical challenges with a concerning decline in perfect order rates and noticeable increases in lead times. 

In contrast, **Supplier D** stands out for exceptional perfect order rates and unwavering lead time stability, though it contends with a stubbornly high back order rate. 

**Supplier B** demonstrates commendable progress in improving both perfect order rates and lead times, but its operational efficiency is hampered by the highest transportation costs. 

Meanwhile, **Supplier C** maintains a moderate back-order rate and consistently improves its perfect order accuracy, signaling steady gains in reliability.

### Category Performance:

**Furniture:** Identified as a "Profitable Engine" with high inventory turnover, low average COGS (especially due to Supplier C's efficiency), and swift stock movement.

**Clothing:** Poses a "Major Challenge" due to low inventory turnover, high COGS (exacerbated by Supplier C's highest COGS in this category), high average units sold, and issues with overstocking linked to poor forecasting and long lead times.

**Electronics:** Supplier A is noted for providing items with the lowest COGS and most stable lead time.

**Accessories:** Suppliers B and D are noted as interchangeable providers with appropriate COGS and lead time rates.

## 5. Recommendations
Based on these insights, targeted recommendations are proposed:

### Supplier-Specific Recommendations
**Supplier A:** Urgently investigate and address the declining perfect order rate and increasing lead times to restore consistent service quality and reliability.

**Supplier B:** Continue the positive trajectory in perfect order rate and lead time reduction, while primarily focusing on optimizing the supply chain to reduce back orders and transportation expenses for balanced efficiency.

**Supplier C:** Reinforce the positive changes in perfect order accuracy and explore opportunities to accelerate this progress and overall performance.

**Supplier D:** Drastically reduce the high back order rate by improving forecasting and inventory planning to fully leverage its strong service capabilities and consistent delivery.

### Category-Specific Recommendations
**Furniture Category:** Expand product line by exploring new furniture styles to capitalize on existing demand. Strengthen supplier ties, especially with Supplier C (known for lowest COGS for furniture), negotiating volume discounts where possible.

**Clothing Category:** Implement data-driven forecasting models that integrate market appeal and weather patterns for accurate demand prediction. Focus on procuring items from suppliers with lower COGS (e.g., Supplier A) and less lead time variability to gain better control over delivery times and minimize over-ordering and stock shortages.
