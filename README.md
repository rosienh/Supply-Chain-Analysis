## 1. Background and Overview
This document presents a detailed supply chain performance analysis designed to help decision-makers optimize operational efficiency, reduce costs, and improve service reliability across **four strategic suppliers (A–D)** and **four core product categories (Furniture, Clothing, Electronics, Accessories)**.
Covering the period from 2020 to 2024, the analysis examines key metrics such as backorder rates, transportation costs, perfect order rates, lead time variability, and inventory efficiency (COGS, turnover). By pinpointing critical performance gaps and providing actionable, data-driven recommendations, this analysis serves as a roadmap for strategic supply chain improvement and sustainable profitability.

## 2. Key Supply Chain Metrics Analyzed 
The analysis is built upon detailed quantitative data points for each supplier and category, including:

**Supplier Performance Metrics:**

- Back Order Rate (percentage of unfulfilled orders)

- Transportation Cost per Unit ($)

- Perfect Order Rate (indicating fulfillment accuracy and completeness)

- Lead Time Variability (days, reflecting consistency in delivery)

**Category Performance Metrics:**
 
- Safety Stock Coverage (days)

- Cost of Goods Sold (COGS) by supplier and category ($k)

- Inventory Turnover (rate)

- Average Units Sold (items)

## 3. Executive Summary
This analysis identifies critical disparities in supplier and category performance, revealing significant opportunities to improve operational efficiency and profitability. Supplier D demonstrates exceptional perfect order rates and lead time stability, while Supplier A excels in inventory control but faces declining order accuracy. Furniture emerges as the most profitable category, whereas Clothing presents major challenges due to high costs and poor turnover.

Targeted recommendations are presented to address these gaps, focusing on reducing back orders, improving forecasting, and optimizing supplier relationships. Implementing these actions is projected to enhance service levels, reduce operational costs, and strengthen overall supply chain resilience.

## 4. Insights Deep Dive
Initial insights reveal significant disparities in supplier performance and category health:

### Supplier Performance
**Supplier A:** Excels in inventory control with the lowest back order rate but requires immediate action to address a declining perfect order rate and increasing lead time variability.

**Supplier B:** Shows strong improvement in perfect order rate and lead times but is hindered by the highest transportation costs.

**Supplier C:** Maintains moderate back order rates and steadily improves perfect order accuracy, indicating reliable overall performance.

**Supplier D:** Delivers excellent perfect order rates and stable lead times but struggles with a persistently high back order rate, suggesting potential issues in demand planning or stock allocation.

### Category Performance
**Furniture:** High inventory turnover and low average COGS, particularly driven by Supplier C, position this category as a strong profit generator.

**Clothing:** Low turnover and high COGS, combined with overstocking and forecasting issues, present significant operational challenges.

**Electronics:** Benefiting from Supplier A’s stable lead times and low COGS, this category shows promising performance potential.

**Accessories:** Balanced performance from Suppliers B and D, maintaining acceptable cost and lead time levels.


## 5. Recommendations
Based on these insights, targeted recommendations are proposed:

### Supplier-Specific Recommendations
**Supplier A:** Prioritize resolution of declining perfect order rates and rising lead times to restore consistency and service quality.

**Supplier B:** Continue improvements in order accuracy and lead time reduction while implementing cost optimization strategies to reduce transportation expenses.

**Supplier C:** Strengthen efforts to improve perfect order accuracy further and explore opportunities to enhance cost efficiency.

**Supplier D:** Address high back order rates through improved forecasting and inventory planning to leverage strong operational capabilities fully.

### Category-Specific
**Furniture:** Expand product offerings to meet growing demand and strengthen relationships with key suppliers (particularly Supplier C) to secure favorable terms.

**Clothing:** Implement advanced, data-driven forecasting models incorporating market trends and seasonal factors. Prioritize sourcing from suppliers with lower COGS and reduced lead time variability to minimize excess inventory and control costs.

**Electronics & Accessories:** Maintain current sourcing strategies while exploring further opportunities to improve cost efficiency and supply stability.

## 6. Impact Summary
Based on historical performance data and industry benchmarks, the proposed improvements are estimated to increase perfect order rates by up to 15%, reduce transportation costs by approximately 10–12%, and significantly strengthen overall supply chain resilience (e.g., more stable lead times and fewer stockouts).
